# Maple
Welcome to the Maple repository!
Maple is a CPU path-tracer with the sole purpose of rendering amazing pictures.

# Prerequisites
- CMake 3.15 and up.
- A C++ 17 compatible compiler.
- Fast CPU (not necessary, but will decrease rendering time significantly).

# Building the project
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the root directory and create a build directory.
3. Move into the newly created build directory.
4. Run `cmake .. -G <generator name here> -A x64`. (replace the generator name with the name of your IDE)
5. Compile and run.

# About Maple
First and foremost, Maple is used to teach me about path-tracing. It is my very first path-tracer.
The fundamentals are based on "Raytracing in a Weekend" by Peter Shirley, but have been adapted and expanded upon.
